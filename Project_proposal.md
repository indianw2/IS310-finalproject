# **Project Proposal- India Wright**
I want to build the ideal running playlist to get me through a marathon. I deliberated for a while between this and another option (exploring the history of alternative music), but ultimately I think I could actually use this in my life.

The idea behind this is to make a playlist that, according to song data like BPM, mood, main instruments, and musical key, will flow from one song to the next and support me through a (hypothetical) marathon race. I’ve always been interested in music theory, which is why I chose this option. My family is full of runners, so running playlists are always being shared in our group chats. My dad has been running in the state marathon for five years now, and he would ask me to make running playlists for him to keep him on pace. I used his “liked songs” on Spotify, and did it by hand. I don’t have that playlist anymore, unfortunately. I’ve made “curated” playlists before, but only in a subjective way, never consulting data like mood or genre. I don’t have experience using a computer that uses data to build a playlist. I’ve done this manually, so I know what types of things to look for.

As far as running resources go, I think dad will be a valuable person to consult about the logistics of running a marathon. Another resource that will be helpful is my own running data. I know my own stride length and pace that I’m comfortable with.

As far as the music data goes, a helpful website is https://tunebat.com/. I’ve used it before, and it gives me all the information I need. The only other thing I can think of that I’d need for the music side is my own liked songs on Spotify. 

I will have to collect data on a few fronts: my own running patterns and data from my “liked songs” on Spotify, using Tunebat. I’ll also have to do some more research on how pacing throughout a marathon changes. For example, I know my dad’s pace fluctuates a lot towards the end of his races. That would influence the BPM and mood of the songs towards the end of the playlist. I’ve never run a marathon before, but I think I could make a good guess as to how one would go for me.

I will have to collect my data for this project. I’ll have to compile the complete list of my liked songs on Spotify (there are 1,175 of them). Then, I’ll need to get all the information about those songs from Tunebat, probably by scraping the website. Alternatively, I could do the inverse of that, where I find the “best” running songs for me on Tunebat, and then compare them with my liked songs on Spotify. I’m not sure which method would be best, or if there’s another one I’m missing entirely.

I’m a chronic procrastinator, and this semester has not been kind to me. With that being said, I need to make a plan for the rest of the semester to get this project done over the next five weeks.

# **Task Outline**
### Mar 27- Apr 2
- Take notes when I’m at the gym: get average stride lengths solidified
- Learn how to scrape Tunebat, I’ll probably have to consult Prof. LeBlanc
### Apr 3-9
- Break down how I want the playlist to be structured
- Will the BPM stay the same throughout?
- How many mood changes do I need?
- Consulting my dad will be helpful at this stage
### Apr 10-16
- Start scraping TuneBat and/or Spotify
- Possibly have a prototype, start narrowing down what I can and can’t accomplish with my time and energy, probably need to consult with Prof. LeBlanc if I decide I was too optimistic at the beginning of the project
### Apr 17-23
- Have a working, logical playlist that I can explain to others
- Maybe make a website explaining how the project went for me(?) Again, trying not to bite off too much, but it would be interesting
### May 1-7
- Complete the project

## **Note**
> It would be awesome to make it customizable and develop a tool that anyone could use, combining race length with their spotify history, stride lengths, and other factors. I've been talking to my dad about this, and he gave me a lot of great ideas, but I don’t want to bite off more than I can chew. I’m already not a strong programmer, and that would be way too much, although interesting. If anyone ever wanted to supply me with the backend things, I’d love to make it happen.
